# The Angular Boot Camp Leaderboard Table

Let's create a system that shows the leaderboard table of the Angular Bootcamp attendees. The table ranking should be based on the grading of the overall assignments.

The system must allow the user to:

- Update the students' information.
- See the leaderboard table, filter it, re-order it and anything else you deem necessary.
- Select a student in the leaderboard to see his/her details.

The leaderboard should provide visual cues to aid the understanding of the information. In such terms:

- The top scores should be highlighted.
- When there are missing assignments a visual cue should be present.
- When there are NOT missing assignments a visual cue should be present

The leaderboard table should have two views the user can switch from:

- Full View:
    - Full Name
    - Photo
    - Average Grade
    - \# of Delivered Homeworks
    - \# of Missing Homeworks
    - Last time the student's information was updated

- Compact View:
    - Full Name
    - Photo
    - Average Grade

## Should Use

- All (or most of) the concepts learned during the Boot Camp
- Angular Forms, Router, Material
- An in-memory API
- Default dummy information (including photos)

## Evaluation Criteria

- Scalability of your application given the supplied information (be practical)
- Correct use of the concepts learned during the Boot Camp
- Code cleanness (Types, Format, Readability)
- Usability (visual)

## Extra points

You will get extra points if you:

- Use features of Angular that weren't taught
- Add a README.MD that explains how you abstracted your solution
