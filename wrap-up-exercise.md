# Wrap Up Exercise

1. Let's create an Application with two fields and a button: 

**Fields:**
    - Article
    - Value

**Buttons:**
    - Submit 

2. Once the button is submitted the app should calculate the VAT(`19%`) of the article and output the following message for the input (Tesla, 30000):

```
The Tesla costs $30,000.00
The VAT is $1,900.00
The total is: $31,900.00`
```

3. After that, let's create another section in the application with the same fields as above but this time it should calculate the VAT with `16%`.

## Conditions:

- VAT calculation should be made in a service
- Use dummy and smart components
- Use pipe for formatting
- Make sure you use Modules (Feature, Shared, etc.)
